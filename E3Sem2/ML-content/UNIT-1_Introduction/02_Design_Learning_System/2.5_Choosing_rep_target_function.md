## The Problem of Size


Now that we have agreed that our learning system must discover a function **V(b)** that evaluates how good or bad a chess position is, the next question is:


**How should we represent this function so that a computer can learn it?**


In principle, we could just tell the computer: *"Memorize every possible chess board position and assign it a specific score."*


But this is impossible. There are estimated to be **10^47** (10 to the power of 47) possible legal chess positions. This number is vast—it exceeds the number of atoms in our galaxy. Even if we could store them, the program would never encounter the same board twice, so "memorizing" the answer to one specific board would never help it with a new, slightly different board.


Humans do not memorize outcomes; they understand **patterns**. Therefore, we must choose a compact, learnable representation that captures these patterns.


## Analogy: The Doctor and the Vitals


To understand how we simplify a complex problem like chess, consider a doctor diagnosing a patient.


A human body contains trillions of cells and millions of biochemical processes occurring every second. If a doctor had to analyze every single cell to make a diagnosis, they would never finish. The data is too vast.


Instead, the doctor extracts a few **key features** (vitals) that represent the patient's overall state:


* Pulse rate
* Oxygen saturation
* Blood pressure
* Body temperature


These few numbers are a **representation** of the patient's condition. They compress billions of data points into a manageable summary.


## Feature-Based Representation for Chess


We apply the exact same principle to our chess program. We cannot use the full, infinite microscopic detail of the board. We must choose **features** that capture the essential strategic information.


Let us define a simple set of strategic features (**x1** through **x6**) for any given board state **b**:


* **x1 (Material):** The piece value difference (e.g., number of your pieces minus opponent's pieces).
* **x2 (King Safety):** A score representing how well-protected the King is.
* **x3 (Center Control):** The number of pieces controlling the central squares (d4, d5, e4, e5).
* **x4 (Structure):** A score measuring the quality of the pawn structure.
* **x5 (Mobility):** The number of legal moves available (indicates flexibility).
* **x6 (Threats):** The number of your pieces currently under attack.


These features mirror exactly what a chess coach teaches a beginner: *"Control the center," "Keep the King safe,"* and *"Don't lose material."*


## The Linear Evaluation Function


Now that we have our features, we must combine them into a single score. We will choose a **Linear Combination** as our representation.


The evaluation function **V(b)** will be calculated as:


**V(b) = w0 + w1(x1) + w2(x2) + w3(x3) + w4(x4) + w5(x5) + w6(x6)**


### Understanding the Weights (w)


In this equation, the **x** values are the inputs from the board, but the **w** values (weights) are what the system must **learn**.


* **w0:** A constant bias.
* **w1 ... w6:** These determine the relative importance of each feature.


For example:


* If the system learns a **large positive w1**, it means "Material advantage is the most important thing for winning."
* If the system learns a **large positive w3**, it means "Controlling the center is critical."
* If the system learns a **large negative w6**, it means "Having pieces under attack is very bad."


**Thus, "learning to play chess" simply reduces to "finding the correct numbers for weights w0 through w6."**


## Why This Representation Works


By describing the board using only 6 numbers instead of trillions of possibilities, we reduce the complexity of the problem massively.


1. **Generalization:** If the machine learns that "Center Control (x3) is good," it can apply that rule to *any* board position, even one it has never seen before.
2. **Efficiency:** It allows the learning algorithm to work with a realistic amount of data.

## Current Status of Design


We have now defined the core components of our Chess Learning System.


**Task (T):** Play winning Chess.
**Performance Measure (P):** Percent of games won in official tournaments.
**Training Experience (E):** Games played against itself (Self-Play).
**Target Function:** V : Board -> Score (Assigns a score to every board).
**Target Function Representation:** V(b) = w0 + w1(x1) + ... + w6(x6) (Linear combination of strategic features).


**Next Step:**
We have the equation, but the weights (w) are currently unknown. How do we find the correct values for them?
**This leads to Section : Choosing a Function Approximation Algorithm.**
