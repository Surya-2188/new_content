# **Attributes of Training Experience : A Human-Centric Understanding**


In the previous chapter, we established that any learning problem — whether human or machine — must specify three components:


* **T (Task)** → what must be learned
* **P (Performance measure)** → how improvement is evaluated
* **E (Experience)** → the exposure or practice through which learning happens


We now shift our attention entirely to **Experience (E)**.
Humans learn effortlessly from life, but machines must be given E with mathematical precision.
This chapter explores **why defining experience E is far more subtle than it appears**, even in human terms.


Tom Mitchell describes **three attributes** of training experience.
Understanding these through natural, real-world human analogies makes the later mathematical discussion intuitive.


We proceed attribute by attribute.


---


#  ATTRIBUTE 1: **Type of Feedback — Direct vs Indirect**


The first question in defining experience is:


> **When someone practices a skill, what kind of feedback do they receive?**


Humans naturally learn under two modes.


---


##  **1. Direct Feedback — Clear, Step-by-Step Correction**


This is like a sports or music coach who explains every detail:


* “Your posture should be like this.”
* “Move your hand this way.”
* “This technique is incorrect — here is why.”


The learner receives **high-information, unambiguous guidance**.


Humans thrive under direct feedback because:


* there is no confusion
* mistakes become learning opportunities
* progress is predictable
* stress is low
* the correct path is visible


---


##  **2. Indirect Feedback — Only Final Results Are Given**


Here the coach does not explain individual moves.
You only hear:


* “Good job, you won.”
* “You lost, try again.”


No explanation of:


* which action was wrong
* which part of your performance collapsed
* whether the early steps were excellent or terrible


If a task requires 40 or 60 decisions (like a long game or a dance routine), and the only feedback is:


 “You lost.”


you learn **nothing** about which step to improve.


This creates the **credit assignment problem** — the difficulty of determining which specific action caused the outcome.


Humans often experience:


* frustration
* anxiety
* demotivation
* confusion


when they receive vague, outcome-only feedback.


Communication becomes essential because **indirect feedback forces us to guess** the cause of success or failure.


---


###  **Why Attribute 1 Matters**


Humans handle indirect feedback with resilience and intuition.
Machines cannot — they require explicit indicators of which actions were right or wrong.


Thus:


> **The type of feedback in experience E dramatically shapes how easily a learner can improve its performance P on task T.**


---


#  ATTRIBUTE 2: **Who Controls the Experience — Teacher, Learner, Environment, or Exploration?**


Even after deciding what type of feedback to give, there remains a deeper question:


> **Who decides which situations or examples the learner will encounter?**


Humans learn in a variety of control structures.


---


##  **1. Teacher-Controlled Experience — Structured, Predictable Learning**


A filmmaking student working under a senior director learns:


* standard camera setups
* accepted lighting techniques
* traditional storytelling structure
* industry norms


The teacher chooses what the student sees and practices.
This creates stable, reliable, predictable learning.


---


##  **2. Learner-Controlled Experience — Asking Questions, Seeking Examples**


Some learners shape their own learning:


* “Show me that scene breakdown again.”
* “I need more examples of emotional pacing.”
* “Can you explain why this sequence works?”


This personalized exploration accelerates skill acquisition.


Humans are naturally good at identifying their weaknesses and seeking targeted experience.


---


##  **3. Environment-Controlled Experience — Random, Unpredictable Learning**


Often, life teaches us through experiences we never chose:


* unexpected challenges
* sudden opportunities
* accidental mistakes
* chaotic real-world conditions


A filmmaker working outdoors faces:


* unpredictable lighting
* unexpected sounds
* spontaneous crowd behavior


These random events still shape learning.


---


##  **4. Self-Generated Experience — Creativity Through Exploration**


Some learners **create their own training environment**, breaking all rules.


This is where groundbreaking innovation happens.


---


#  **Neo-Realism Example: Bicycle Thieves and the Power of Self-Generated Experience**


**This is the clearest demonstration of Attribute 2.**


Before *Bicycle Thieves*, filmmaking followed strict studio traditions:


* professional actors
* artificial sets
* polished scripts
* staged lighting


But Vittorio De Sica **invented his own form of experience** by stepping outside all established norms.


He chose to learn and create in an environment of his own making:


* shooting on real streets
* using non-professional actors
* embracing natural light
* capturing raw daily life
* portraying real human struggle


This was not taught to him.
No curriculum prescribed this path.
He **generated his own experience** — a learning environment entirely outside convention.


This audacity created **Italian Neo-Realism**, a movement that reshaped world cinema.


###  Why This Matters for Attribute 2


Self-generated experience demonstrates:


* the power of exploration
* the emergence of creativity
* learning beyond formal instruction
* the human ability to redefine the environment itself


Machines cannot do this.
A machine cannot invent Neo-Realism unless we explicitly define its environment and boundaries of exploration.


Humans are born explorers.
Machines are born rule-followers.


---


#  ATTRIBUTE 3: **How Well the Experience Matches the Real-World Test Conditions**


The third and final attribute concerns another subtle, profound question:


> **Are the situations encountered during learning similar to the situations where performance is actually evaluated?**


Humans adapt effortlessly across environments.
Machines cannot.


Let us understand this mismatch.


---


##  **1. Medical Students Studying Abroad**


A student trained in one country:


* learns diseases common there
* understands local patient behavior
* absorbs local medical procedures


When they return home, everything changes:


* new diseases
* new climate
* new cultural practices
* new medical expectations


Their training experience **E** does not match the environment where their performance **P** will be evaluated.


Even a brilliant student may struggle until they adapt.


---


##  **2. Overtraining in a Controlled Environment**


A filmmaker trained only in a controlled indoor studio learns:


* perfect lighting
* clean backgrounds
* predictable actors
* fixed sound conditions


But shooting a documentary outdoors requires:


* spontaneity
* improvisation
* handling crowds
* dealing with lighting chaos
* quick emotional decisions


Their training environment does not match real conditions.


They must rebuild their intuition from scratch.


---


##  **3. The Checkers Example (Intuitive Explanation)**


If a learner practices only by playing against itself:


* it develops strategies that work only in its own micro-world
* it never sees the kinds of moves used by real human champions
* it becomes good in training but weak in real gameplay


The learner's training world and performance world are misaligned.


---


#  **Why Attribute 3 Matters**


Humans generalize across environments because evolution has shaped us for adaptability.
We transfer knowledge fluidly.
We survive change.


Machines cannot generalize naturally.
If their training environment differs even slightly from the real-world environment, their performance collapses.


Thus:


> **Experience E must closely match the world in which performance P is evaluated.**


Otherwise, improving on E teaches nothing about T.


---


#  **Grand Insight from All Three Attributes**


Humans are master learners because:


* we handle unclear feedback
* we adapt to unpredictable environments
* we explore creatively
* we learn from a lifetime of chaotic, varied experiences
* evolution has shaped our learning machinery for survival


Machines, however:


* require explicit feedback
* need clearly defined experience
* cannot reinvent their own environment
* cannot absorb randomness meaningfully
* fail when training conditions differ from real conditions
* rely on mathematical rigor, not intuitive adaptability


Thus:


> **The design of the training experience E — its feedback, its source, and its similarity to real life — determines whether learning is even possible.**


This is the foundation on which the rest of machine learning will be built.



---


#  **Designing a Learning System: Moving From Checkers to Chess**


In the checkers example, we made a design choice:


> **Let the system train by playing games against itself.**


This eliminated the need for an external trainer and allowed the learner to generate unlimited experience.
Once we fixed this source of training experience, we could clearly specify:


* **Task (T):** playing checkers
* **Performance measure (P):** percent of games won in the world tournament
* **Training experience (E):** games played against itself


Now, to fully design the learning system, we needed to choose:


1. **the type of knowledge to be learned**
2. **a representation for that knowledge**
3. **a mechanism for learning (how the representation improves with experience)**


Let us now **parallel this reasoning for a chess-playing system**, since chess is far more familiar to most readers and visually richer.


---


#  **A Chess Learning Problem (Parallel to the Checkers Setup)**


Suppose our goal is to build a program capable of competing in strong chess tournaments.
To make the problem well-posed, we again specify:


### ✔ **Task (T):**


Playing chess — choosing moves from any given legal board position.


### ✔ **Performance Measure (P):**


Percentage of games won in a standard international-rated chess tournament.


### ✔ **Training Experience (E):**


Games the program plays **against itself**, just like in the checkers example.


Self-play has the advantage that:


* no human coach is needed
* the system can generate as much experience as it wants
* it can explore a large variety of board positions
* it can refine its playing strength endlessly


With this, the chess learning problem is formally specified.


---


#  **Next Steps in Designing the Chess Learning System**


Just as in checkers, to complete the design we must choose:


### **1. The type of knowledge to be learned**


(e.g., an evaluation of how good a position is, principles of attack/defense, opening ideas)


### **2. A representation for this knowledge**


(e.g., features of the board, patterns, piece activity, king safety, pawn structure)


### **3. A learning mechanism**


(how the representation improves from experience — we explain this later)


Before diving into these, let us ground the reader visually by showing **a real chess winning position** — because this will help them imagine what kind of knowledge the system needs to learn.

#  **Chess Winning Position: Checkmate Example**


Below is a classical checkmate pattern:
**White wins by delivering checkmate on the black king.**

---


#  **Why Show a Winning Chess Position?**


Because this makes it intuitive that:


* The system must learn to recognize *advantageous* positions
* It must learn what patterns lead to *victory*
* It must understand what configurations of pieces signal *danger or opportunity*
* It must eventually map board states to the **probability of winning**
